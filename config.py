#Use this to configure tests, for now all that was needed was to setup the type of browser
#(FF, Chrome, IE), please note that to use these you must download the appropriate driver
# however firefox is already included in selenium by default
#I will include a link below to each driver. Also please not that the IE driver is windows only

#browser = "Chrome" # https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home

#browser = "IE" # https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver

browser = "Firefox"
